GST in reality is ‘Good and Simple Tax’.
GST = Goods and Service Tx - One Country and One tax - Excllent scheme by Modiji.
GST is an Indirect Tax which has replaced many Indirect Taxes in India. The Goods and Service Tax Act was passed in the Parliament on 29th March 2017.
Under the GST regime, the tax is levied at every point of sale. In the case of intra-state sales, Central GST and State GST are charged. Inter-state sales are chargeable to Integrated GST.
GST has mainly removed the Cascading effect on the sale of goods and services. Removal of cascading effect has impacted the cost of goods. Since the GST regime eliminates the tax on tax, the cost of goods decreases.
GST is also mainly technologically driven. All activities like registration, return filing, application for refund and response to notice needs to be done online on the GST Portal; this accelerates the processes.
In the earlier indirect tax regime, there were many indirect taxes levied by both state and centre. States mainly collected taxes in the form of Value Added Tax (VAT). Every state had a different set of rules and regulations.
Interstate sale of goods was taxed by the Centre. CST (Central State Tax) was applicable in case of interstate sale of goods.  Other than above there were many indirect taxes like entertainment tax, octroi and local tax that was levied by state and centre.
GST has removed this cascading effect as the tax is calculated only on the value-addition at each stage of the transfer of ownership.
In the case of Goods and Services Tax, there is a way to claim credit for tax paid in acquiring input. What happens in this case is, the individual who has paid a tax already can claim credit for this tax when he submits his taxes.
In the end, every time an individual is able to claim the input tax credit, the sale price is reduced and the cost price for the buyer is reduced because of lower tax liability. The final value of the biscuits is therefore reduced from Rs. 2,244 to Rs. 1,980, thus reducing the tax burden on the final customer.
GST regime also brought a centralised system of waybills by the introduction of “E-way bills”. This system was launched on 1st April 2018 for Inter-state movement of goods and on 15th April 2018 for intra-state movement of goods in a staggered manner. Under the e-way bill system, manufacturers, traders & transporters are now able to generate e-way bills for the goods transported from the place of its origin to its destination on a common portal with ease.
Tax authorities are also benefitted as this system has reduced time at check -posts and help reduce tax evasion.
Reduces tax burden on producers and fosters growth through more production. The current taxation structure, pumped with myriad tax clauses, prevents manufacturers from producing to their optimum capacity and retards growth. GST will take care of this problem by providing tax credit to the manufacturers.
Different tax barriers, such as check posts and toll plazas, lead to wastage of unpreserved items being transported. This penalty transforms into major costs due to higher needs of buffer stock and warehousing costs. A single taxation system will eliminate this roadblock.
There will be more transparency in the system as the customers will know exactly how much taxes they are being charged and on what base.
GST will add to the government revenues by extending the tax base.GST will provide credit for the taxes paid by producers in the goods or services chain. This is expected to encourage producers to buy raw material from different registered dealers and is hoped to bring in more vendors and suppliers under the purview of taxation.
GST will remove the custom duties applicable on exports. The nation’s competitiveness in foreign markets will increase on account of lower costs of transaction.
The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax will be a very noteworthy step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. By merging a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax, GST is expected to significantly ease double taxation and make taxation overall easy for the industries.
GST is a transparent tax and also reduce number of indirect taxes.GST will not be a cost to registered retailers therefore there will be no hidden taxes and and the cost of doing business will be lower.
Separate taxes for goods and services, which is the present taxation system, requires division of transaction values into value of goods and services for taxation, leading to greater complications, administration, including compliances costs.

GST brings Investment boost - For many capital goods, input tax credit is not available. Full input tax credit under GST will mean a 12-14% drop in the cost of capital goods. Expected: A 6% rise in capital goods investment, 2% overall.

GST will be payable at the final point of consumption on the price of goods and services; termed as a “transaction value.” This transaction value or actual paid price, while buying the good or service, will include packing cost, commission, and all other expenses incurred for their sales. To start with, the GST Council has finalized four tax rates slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% for goods and services.

Prior to implementation of GST, for example entrepreneurs having business interests in seven states would have to deal with seven different tax authorities along with seven different tax rates in value added tax (VAT) paid by them.

GST has brought about a uniformity in process and centralized registration that will make starting a business and expanding in different states much simpler.
Since startups lack the resources to hire tax experts or a dedicated team for handling varied forms of tax compliance, GST’s objective is to simplify the tax regime by reducing the multiplicity of taxes.
Reduction in logistics cost and time taken across states - GST will ensure that interstate movement becomes cheaper and is less time consuming, by eliminating small border taxes and resolving check post issues.
Higher exemptions to new businesses -GST also introduces an optional scheme called the composition scheme, which empowers small businesses with turnover between $30,000 and $77,000 (Rs 20 and 50 lakhs) to pay lower taxes. 
Financial Inclusion -In the long run, GST will enable financial inclusion in the economy. With the startup community migrating towards digital book-keeping and optimizing existing processes, they would be better predisposed towards fulfilling the eligibility criteria for credit facilities by banks and investors in India and abroad.
