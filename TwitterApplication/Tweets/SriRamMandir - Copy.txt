For the welfare of all the Indians and to have communal harmony we need Ram mandir to be started ASAP.
CJI / SC may not help us in anyways – Ordinance may be the only option to start Sri Ram mandir ASAP.
We waited for 5 years – with President, VP, PM etc. all ours and with this golden chance, this may be the right time to start Sri Ram mandir construction.
All Hindus have lost hope on Modi government -a s they did not take any steps for Sri Ram Mandir construction.
If we cannot build a temple for Sri Ram in his birthplace, where else can we build? Shia WAQ board is ready to give acceptance – what now?
Modiji – Justice delayed is justice denied – I have lost hopes on SC and CJI. We need an ordinance in the next 24 hours. We don’t need any constitution benches here.
Previous CJI said Sri Ram Mandir is only a title case – But this CJI says we need a constitutional ebch – Its only Ram Bhakts and Lord Sri Ram which is affected by SC.
If a Pakistan and a Bangladesh was formed just to appease minorities, why should we not build Ram mandir now? They can build a mosque elsewhere.
If a million-year-old Epic – Srimad Ramayana cannot be honored and our son of the soil Sri Ram cannot be honored what’s the use of having a democracy?
Modiji & Yogiji – you both talk like Netaji but in action – you are worse than Nehruji – this beats the purpose of having a non-congress rulership.
Soft Hinduthva vs Hard Hinduthva – I don’t care – if Lord Sri Ramachandra is not honored it doesn’t matter if you build statue of liberty or if you just pose to pictures.
Things are not looking very good for BJP now – Sri Ram is the only savior who can help you win 2019 – Please act now – it’s not too late even now.
If NarasimhaRao & Swami have given solutions to this issue already, what are we waiting on? 
Modiji – the fervor in your talks – pls show them in your actions too. Sava Sour Karod Deshwasis need Ram mandir ASAP.
Prove to the world that you are better than Congress and will honor the traditions of the land.
We need to Vow all common Hindu voters – no matter what we do Xians and Muslims will not vote for you. Please don’t bring SriRam into politics.
Modiji after 2019 elections if you do not want to enact the same drama that Sri Yedyurappa ji did in Karnatka last year, better act on this today.
Yogi in UP, Ramnath Ji as President and Modiji as PM – what’s the use? Still Sri Ram is living in a tent in Ayodhya. Until we fix that BJP will not win 2019 elections.
This temple was supposed to be started when Yogiji became the CM of UP. But still nothing seems to happen. Just an interview to India TV is not enough.
As per National Ratings BJP may not win more than 233 seats – if you remain silent and over-confident then be ready to face the defeat. Or else act on Ram mandir.
Yogiji – who cares how much you spend on Kumbh mela – we need Ram mandir construction started before the end of this January. 
Yogiji – How are you better than Akilesh & Mayawati? Please start the construction of Sri Ram Mandir and prove that you are a true yogi.
If a common man cannot go to Sri Ram mandi and chat Jai Sree Ram, what’ the use of this independence? It’s my basic right to pray that has been denied.
Previous CJI screwed up Sabari mala & this one screwed up Ajodhya. Why not impeach this CJI and then pass an ordinance? How long will you be silent?
If you leave Sri Ramji in the tent – it doesn’t matter how much you spend on Kumba Mela or how many statues you build – still people of India will not be happy.
Whether you lose 2019 or not – make a bold decision and start Sri Ram mandir project – Sri Ram will give you another chance for sure.
